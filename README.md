# Polynomial-division
Smart contract-based polynomial division

To test the [code](https://github.com/anonymous2012000/Polynomial-division/blob/main/polynomial-division.sol), one can:
1. copy the source code into an online compiler such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. pass the following values as input:
   * phi = [1, 5, 6]    // Represents 1·x² + 5·x + 6
   * a = 1              // Coefficient of x in zeta(x)
   * b = 2              // Constant term in zeta(x)


The returned value will be true. Users can see the value of a and b to some other arbitrary values, e.g, 5, and 8 to test whether the related function returns false.
