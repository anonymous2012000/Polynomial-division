# Polynomial-division
smart contract-based polynomial division

To test the code, one can:
1. copy the source code into an online compiler such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. pass the following values as input:
   * phi = [1, 5, 6]    // Represents 1·x² + 5·x + 6
   * a = 1              // Coefficient of x in zeta(x)
   * b = 2              // Constant term in zeta(x)


The returned value will be true.
